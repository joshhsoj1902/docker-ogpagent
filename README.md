# docker-ogpagent

Dockerized version of the [Open Game Panel Linux Agent](https://github.com/OpenGamePanel/OGP-Agent-Linux).

Supports most of the essential features for running games, I don't use features like ftp or cron so there may be some holes in what actually works. Feel free to submit PR's!
